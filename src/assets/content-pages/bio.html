    <p>
        I am a software developer with a strong background as a full-stack developer, as well as
        thirteen years of experience in high performance
        computing systems administration.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a strong background developing back end software using Java, Springboot,
        Hibernate,
        PostgreSQL, MySQL, Perl and Python.
        Back end development is where all the fun happens. Business logic, AOP, scalability,
        CI/CD,
        cloud deployment, and the list goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am proficient in front end development using JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap, JSP
        Scriptlets and HTML/CSS, but my real passion
        is for back end development.
